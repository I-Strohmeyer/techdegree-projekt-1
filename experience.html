        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>
          Plastic has increasingly become a ubiquitous substance in the ocean.
          Due to its size and color, animals confuse the plastic for food,
          causing malnutrition; it poses entanglement risks and threatens their
          overall behavior, health and existence.

        />
        <p>
          Once plastic enters the marine food web, there is a possibility that
          it will contaminate the human food chain as well. Efforts to clean and
          eradicate ocean plastic have also caused significant financial
          burdens.

        <h3>The Great Pacific Garbage Patch</h3>

            >The Great Pacific Garbage Patch</a
          >
          (GPGP) is the largest of the five offshore plastic accumulation zones
          in the world’s oceans. It is located halfway between Hawaii and
          California.
        </p>
        <p>
          The patch is not easily seen from the sky, because the plastic is
          dispersed over a large area. Researchers from The Ocean Cleanup
          project claimed that the patch covers 1.6 million square kilometers.
          The plastic concentration is estimated to be up to 100 kilograms per
          square kilometer in the center, going down to 10 kilograms per square
          kilometer in the outer parts of the patch. An estimated 80,000 metric
          tons of plastic inhabit the patch, totaling 1.8 trillion pieces. 92%
          of the mass in the patch comes from objects larger than 0.5
          centimeters.
