          I’m a weary traveler that has seen a lot, one could almost say I have
          seen too much.

          Imagine seeing your friends struggle for their life, because they have
          either eaten something that is now commonly found floating in the
          ocean, and if it's not that, then they get strangled by plastic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am not able to tell you how old I am exactly, but you can assume
          that I have been here for a while. Getting older doesn't make it
          exactly easier seeing the same thing happen again and again, not to
          mention that it's getting worse and worse from year to year. Most
          humans have no idea what we have to deal with and how it's affecting
          us <b>all</b>. Do they even realise that
          <a href="experience.html" target="_blank">this</a> is going to catch
          up to them one way or another? By that time it will be too late for
          many of my friends.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
          In order to help those that are dear to me (including myself) I wish
          to gain knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my
          knowledge, skills and abilities in:
        </p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Angular</li>
          <li>Node.js</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I’d like to work for a non-profit organization that is interested and
          strives to rid our ocean of all the trash that is killing my friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the first step is to raise awareness for this issue and I have
          confidence that once I have a better idea how this
          <i>world wide web</i> works and how exactly humans use it to share,
          exchange and generate content, I will do my part and educate the
          humans living in this world, <b>our</b> only world.
